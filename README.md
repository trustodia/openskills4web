WELCOME! to "openskills4web" project page

The web is a platform/resource for information gathering, research, innovation,networking, collacoration and many more! 
Unfortunnately, some persons do not have the skills,tools and Knowledge to harness the opportunities/benefits offered by the web.
This project is aimed at providing open tools, skills, software, materials and resources(links) for web development/innovation.
I believe that an open web leads to innovation.



## Objectives
1. Get contributions from people on how to go about this (Global Sprint 2018)
2. teach web programming languages (PHP, HTML, what else?)
3. Provide open/online tools, resources and materials for learning web programming/coding
4. organize online workshop/hackfest on web programming (e.g software capentry)
